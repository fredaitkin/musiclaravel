## Music Laravel

"musiclaravel"  is my take on iTunes.  It is very much a work in progress.

Displays songs and artists, enables a user to create and play playlists.

It demonstrates my ability to:
- work with frameworks
- create a web application in PHP
- work with MySQL and Redis databases
- write javascript
- work with Bootstrap and scss to style a website
- work with node to pull jquery-ui and fontawesome packages into the application
- cache data
- create REST api functionality
- serve up an application via valet and wamp
